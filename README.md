# Convolutional NN for sentiment analysis of Spanglish text

-- Course: Research & Development (Autumn 2019), Uppsala university --

-- Data set: SentiMix Spanglish 2019 --

We try and implement different tools and methods that would theoretically improve sentiment classification

## Preprocessing

## Joint character-word embeddings

## Model definition

### Convolutional neural network

### Attention-based recurrent neural network

## Evaluation

- Test set: 1500 sentences (10%)
- Precision, recall, F1 (scikit-learn)
- Confusion matrix (matplotlib)
